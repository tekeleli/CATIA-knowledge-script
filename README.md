/*look at pictures to see what it does*/

you need to create:

    parameters:
        leg_length
        lev_count
        inner_d
        outer_d
    lists in knowledge pattern:
        Points
        circles
        point_2
        spline
        prof
    geometrical sets:
        Geometrical Set.1 (usually is created by default)
        points
        circles
        points_2
        spline
    geometry:
    1. sketch named Sketch.2 lenged by parameter leg_length
    2. point named Point.1 on this skecth with ratio 0

You can change parameters to change it's length, levels count, inner diameter or outer diameter. 
My very first code but maybe it will be helpful for someone
When it's done, you get spline in Geometrical Set.1 and you can just revolve it using
